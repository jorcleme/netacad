## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (will be automatically managed by Selenium)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (will be automatically managed by Selenium)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jorcleme/netacad.git
   cd netacad
   ```

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jorcleme/netacad.git
   cd netacad
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env

   # On Linux/Mac:
   source env/bin/activate

   # On Windows:
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure credentials:**

   **Automatic Setup (Recommended):**
   The startup scripts (`start.sh` for Linux/Mac or `start.ps1` for Windows) will automatically:

   - Create a `.env.development` template file if it doesn't exist
   - Check if valid credentials are configured
   - Prompt you to enter your NetAcad credentials if they're missing or using default values
   - Save your credentials securely to the `.env.development` file

   **Manual Setup (Optional):**
   You can also create and edit the credentials file manually:

   ```bash
   # Create .env.development file manually
   touch .env.development
   echo 'INSTRUCTOR_LOGIN="your_instructor_email@domain.com"' >> .env.development
   echo 'INSTRUCTOR_PASSWORD="your_password"' >> .env.development
   ```

5. **Run the application:**

   **For Linux/Mac users:**

   ```bash
   bash start.sh
   ```

   **For Windows users:**

   ```powershell
   # Right-click start.ps1 and select "Run with PowerShell"
   # Or from PowerShell:
   .\start.ps1
   ```

   **First-time setup behavior:**

   - The script will automatically check for Python installation
   - Create a virtual environment if needed
   - Install dependencies automatically
   - Check for NetAcad credentials and prompt you to enter them if missing
   - Run the course export application

   **Subsequent runs:**

   - The script will validate your existing setup
   - Skip setup steps that are already complete
   - Run the application directly if everything is configured

### Automatic Directory Creation

The application automatically creates the following directories if they don't exist:

- `logs/` - Application logs
- `data/` - Main data directory
  - `data/csv/` - CSV exports (without headers for platform upload)
  - `data/markdown/` - Markdown exports (with headers for LLM processing)

### Windows Users - Quick Start Guide

üéØ **For non-tech users: See [WINDOWS_QUICK_START.md](WINDOWS_QUICK_START.md) for super simple instructions!**

For team members who aren't tech-savvy:

1. **First time setup:**

   - Download/clone the project
   - Double-click `run-app.bat`
   - Follow the prompts (it will set up everything automatically)

2. **Regular use:**

   - Just double-click `run-app.bat` each time you want to export data
   - The application will guide you through the process

3. **Finding your files:**

   - All exported data will be in the `data` folder
   - CSV files: `data/csv/` (for uploading to platforms)
   - Markdown files: `data/markdown/` (for AI/LLM processing)

4. **Create desktop shortcut (optional):**
   - Double-click `create-shortcut.bat` to add a shortcut to your desktop

### Troubleshooting

- **Environment file missing**: The app will create a template `.env.development` file automatically
- **Permission errors**: Ensure you have write permissions in the project directory
- **Chrome driver issues**: Make sure Google Chrome is installed and up to date

**Windows-specific troubleshooting:**

- **"Python not found"**: Install Python from <https://python.org> (check "Add Python to PATH")
- **Script won't run**: Right-click the `.bat` file and select "Run as administrator"
- **PowerShell execution policy**: If `.ps1` scripts won't run, open PowerShell as admin and run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

### File Formats Explained

The application creates two types of files for maximum compatibility:

üìä **CSV Files** (`data/csv/` folder):

- No column headers (for platform compatibility)
- Pure data format for uploading to systems that don't support headers
- Filename format: `GRADEBOOK_DATA_YYYY_MM_DDTHH_MM_SSZ_[course-info].csv`

üìù **Markdown Files** (`data/markdown/` folder):

- Rich formatting with headers and metadata
- Optimized for AI/LLM processing and human readability
- Includes statistical summaries and course information
- Filename format: `GRADEBOOK_DATA_YYYY_MM_DDTHH_MM_SSZ_[course-info].md`

### Validation

You can validate your setup by running:

```bash
python -c "from constants import validate_setup; validate_setup()"
```
